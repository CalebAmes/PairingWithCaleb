  length is 0, this implementation moves low and hi indices to determine
  what part of the original array is being searched. if they meet each other
  we know we have searched the entire array.(NOTE this function has FOUR params)

  Base Case: 
  if low is equal to high and we haven't found targetNum, then return -1 to
  indicate that the value was not found.
  
  Determine the slice point (the difference between low and hi, divided by 2)

  If targetNum is less than nums[slicepoint], then
  return the binary search of nums where low is the beginning of the array, and
  hi is the middle of the array

  If targetNum is less than nums[slicepoint], then
  return the binary search of nums where low is the middle of the array, and hi
  is the end of the array

  we have found our value!
