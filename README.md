# PairingWithCaleb
a/A pair programming

Hello peer. This is my personal pairing repo to make it easier for us to share files 
and build our git contribution history. You will have access for 24 hours
so please manage your own versions of the files accordingly.

Looking forward to working with you ðŸ¤˜
